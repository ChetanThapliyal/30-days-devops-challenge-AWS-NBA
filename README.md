# 30 Days DevOps Challenge

Welcome to my journey through the **30 Days DevOps Challenge**! This repository documents all projects and learning activities as I progress through the challenge, building and improving my DevOps skills.

## Overview
The **30 Days DevOps Challenge** is a structured learning path designed to help participants master core DevOps concepts, tools, and practices. The projects span a variety of DevOps domains, including CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, containerization, and monitoring.
