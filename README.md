# 30 Days DevOps Challenge

Welcome to my journey through the **30 Days DevOps Challenge**! This repository documents all projects and learning activities as I progress through the challenge, building and improving my DevOps skills.

## Overview
The **30 Days DevOps Challenge** is a structured learning path designed to help participants master core DevOps concepts, tools, and practices. The projects span a variety of DevOps domains, including CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, containerization, and monitoring.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized by days, with each day's project in its own folder:

```
.

├── day3-infrastructure-as-code
├── ...
└── day30-final-project
```

Each directory contains:
- **Project code**
- **README.md** detailing the day's objectives, steps, and outcomes

## Tools & Technologies
Throughout this challenge, I will be using a range of tools and technologies, including but not limited to:
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
